# Mango Inc. Copilot Extension

A GitHub Copilot agent-based extension that serves as an AI-powered knowledge assistant for Mango Inc's engineering teams. This extension integrates company resources, best practices, and technical documentation directly into GitHub Copilot, providing contextual assistance to both new and existing team members.

## Key Features

- Instant access to Mango Inc's engineering best practices
- Integration with internal documentation and resources
- Context-aware technical guidance
- Streamlined onboarding for new team members

This project can serve as a template for organizations looking to build their own Copilot extensions to surface company-specific knowledge and practices through AI assistance.
